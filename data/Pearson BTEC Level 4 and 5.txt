## Introduction
Knowing how to implement algorithms and data structures that solve real problems, and knowing the purpose, complexity and use of algorithms is part of an essential toolkit for software engineers. An algorithm is a sequence of instructions used to manipulate data held in a structured form and together with data structures constitute design patterns for solving a diverse range of computer problems, including network analysis, cryptography, data compression and process control. This unit introduces students to data structures and how they are used in algorithms, enabling them to design and implement data structures. Students are introduced to the specification of abstract data types and will explore their use in concrete data structures. Using this knowledge, students should be able to develop solutions by specifying, designing and implementing data structures and algorithms in a variety of programming paradigms for an identified need. Among the topics included in this unit are abstract data types specification, formal data notations, data encapsulation, complex data structures, programming language implementations using handles, pointers, classes and methods, algorithm types, data structure libraries, algorithm complexity, asymptotic testing and benchmarking. On completion of this unit, students should be able to identify program data requirements, specify abstract data types using a formal notation, translate into concrete data structures and be able to develop, using a programming paradigm, different sorting, searching and navigational algorithms that implement complex data structures and evaluate their effectiveness. As a result, students will have developed skills such as communication literacy, critical thinking, analysis, synthesis, reasoning and interpretation, which are crucial for gaining employment and developing academic competence.

## Introduction
Risk-based testing prioritises tests during the system testing phase, based on the highest impact and probability of system failure. The aim of this unit is to give students the knowledge and skills they need to use risk-based testing (RBT), using a medium-sized application, developing a full and detailed RBT procedure and documenting the results. Students will then be able to evaluate the effectiveness of the application and the testing procedures employed. RBT is used widely in industry to organise software testing and to use test resources more efficiently. This unit introduces students to prioritising testing software features according to risk of failure, evaluated as a function of criticality or importance and impact of failure. Risk of software failure determines the priority of tests within a Test Plan, strategically carrying out testing over multiple test cycles. Among the topics included in this unit are: how to classify and evaluate software risks using the risk formula, risk matrix, RBT testing and test build strategies, priority test cycles, security testing, coverage analysis and risk reduction reports. As a result of studying this unit, students will develop skills such as communication literacy, critical thinking, analysis, reasoning and interpretation, which are crucial for gaining employment and developing academic competence.

## Introduction
Digital technology has transformed how people communicate, learn, and work. This sector is one of the most valuable and fastest growing economic areas in most of the world. Although the first electronic digital computer was created in the 1930s, the digital revolution began between the late 1950s and 1970s, when key developments of technologies from mechanical and analogue to digital took place. It was during this time that the use of digital computers and digital record keeping became the norm. The industry has grown rapidly in recent decades and digital technologies are now a part of our daily lives. The digital technologies we are familiar with today are the electronic tools, systems, devices and resources that generate, store or process data. Most popular examples include mobile phones, social media, online games, virtual reality and multimedia. Spanning cultural, creative, educational and many other industries, digital technologies are a vibrant sector with growth that has surpassed the rest of the economy. Digital technology has completely modified the way we live today and in years to come this will be even more incredible. In this unit, students will explore the impact of both the current and emerging digital technologies across different industries and investigate how organisations and businesses use digital technologies to meet their needs. They will also look at how an organisation's strategy and leadership decision making is impacted by digital technology implementation. They will plan a solution for a specific organisation to use a new or emerging technology. This unit can be delivered alongside the Emerging Technologies unit where they must implement a planned solution, thus allowing students an opportunity to demonstrate putting their digital technology implementation plan into action. On successful completion of the unit, students will have explored industry sectors that use digital technologies, the history of the industry, current and emerging digital technologies, and how organisations are adapting and solving problems using digital technologies and planning for the future.

## Introduction
3D sculpting has given rise to exquisite detail and realism, which is applied to a whole host of digital assets across the animation, games and visual effects industries. With the continuous advances in the fields of technology relating to scaling, compute power, sensor accessibility, graphics rendering and streaming, connectivity, portability and user interfaces, specialised, unique applications such as 3D sculpting for virtual reality will continue to support the development and progression of augmented reality (AR). The simultaneous advances and investment in virtual and augmented reality and dedicated devices, mean that 3D sculpting is becoming more practical and accessible and is set to become a staple in the developer’s workflow. The innovative human-computer interface has increased demand for virtual reality (VR) devices and standard spatial input devices now provide accuracy and precision that makes them feasible for digital sculpting, allowing for pressure sensitivity and finger tracking. Combined with high-resolution headsets that provide wide-field view and stereoscopic depth, there has never been a more intuitive suite of technologies that cater for this area of digital creation. This unit covers the technologies (hardware and software innovations) required to experiment with 3D sculpting using VR equipment. Students will use AR-enabled devices to preview and showcase experimentation in real-world scenarios and critically evaluate the workflow of creative digital design and development. On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to analyse the tools and techniques for 3D sculpting, select an appropriate development tool, develop 3D sculptures and virtually showcase 3D sculptures using AR.

## Introduction
Whether we are aware of it, computer-generated imagery (CGI) is a feature of nearly every application. This ranges from the overt, as we might see in high-concept films, or less apparent, as in the presentation of products in marketing materials. Similarly, it may be photorealistic, communicating objects and environments that approximate reality, or it may be more stylised, like animated characters for entertainment purposes. The process of bringing 3D models and animations to life, with some sense of reality or style, requires the application of material, algorithms, and data processing. Whether to create a photorealistic environment for a game or the stylised characters of an animated film, it is through the processes of rendering and application that 2D and 3D models are brought to life. Throughout this course, students will develop the process to create applications and apply algorithms to achieve the look of a high-poly model. They will also perform the data processing to obtain results and algorithms. Students will further use the processing engine to implement algorithms and apply data manipulation techniques to visualise the models within applications.

## Introduction
Application development is a process of planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system. Often applications are developed to automate a process, build a product to address business need or to get ahead of the competition by being innovative. Professionalism and critical thinking supported by an ability to work independently and as part of a team are core skills for a developer. This unit introduces students to application development. It is designed to simulate the roles and responsibilities of a commercial developer working in a suitable business environment, with access to a small team of colleagues. Initially, students are introduced to a business-related problem and will need to adopt and use appropriate methods and practices to analyse, break down and discuss the issues – then decide, design, create and test a possible solution. Students should be free to debate, evaluate and select different design and development methodologies, depending on their own judgement and consideration. Among the topics included in this unit are design and developer documentation; problem analysis; research, system and user requirements; design methodologies and principles; security considerations; development methodologies; software development lifecycles; teamwork, peer reviews, development tools and techniques; integrated development environments; debugging, testing, software versions and quality assurance. On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to produce a software design document by analysing a business-related problem and deduce an appropriate solution, including a set of initial requirements. They will be able to select and use design and development methodologies, with tools and techniques associated with the creation of a business application. They will also be able to work individually and as part of a team to plan, prepare and produce a functional business application with support documentation, and assess and plan improvements to a business application by evaluating its performance against its software design document and initial requirements. As a result, students will develop skills such as communication literacy, critical thinking, analysis, reasoning and interpretation, which are crucial for gaining employment and developing academic competence.

## Introduction
Many applications in use today are a composite or an application method of other software. This is true of an application, be it web-based, mobile or on a desktop where the functionality of one is taken and used to build on. Think of an application that locates nearby restaurants – this may utilise an already existing map service as its basis. Or a game application that enables players to go to invite other players to chat and play a game post high scores to social media, or all within the game environment. How an application interacts with one another of a through an Application Programming Interface (API).
Typically, APIs consist of methods and tools that are developed by an application developers and which can provide services and functionalities development functionalities that can be extended to other developers to other applications by. By providing existing APIs provide a huge range of services and functionality that can be integrated into existing development and can be integrated by following the developer’s API rules of the relevant developer’s API developer’s. One of the advantages in using APIs is by access to integrate into existing and existing applications by providing services that can help speed up development and help with the standardisation of development.
The aim of this unit is to provide a introduction to students to the nature of an API by developing a proof-of-concept application that utilizes an existing API for an existing API to provide a service for a the purposes of a specific purpose. The purpose of this unit is to provide an introduction to a an API to a proof of concept application. By the end of this unit, students will be able to identify and select a suitable API(s) to use in a an application from a given a scenario. They will also be able to test and document their application by the initial design and requirements. The unit includes topics such as identifying what an API is and the role of the need for APIs; types of APIs; types of application development; API design/development; and testing/development.
On successful completion of this unit, students will be able to identify and select relevant APIs to use in an application from a given scenario. They will be able to also be able to test and document the results against the initial design requirement. As a result, students will develop skills such as communication literacy, critical thinking skills, analysis skills, reasoning skills, and interpretation skills, which are critical crucial skills for a successful employment and developing business academic competence.
